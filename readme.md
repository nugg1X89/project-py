Create a README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your ~/project folder that explains your project. This file should include your Project title, the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.

    # YOUR PROJECT TITLE
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description:

If unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub’s Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax helpful. If you are using the CS50 Codespace and are prompted to “Open in CS50 Lab”, you can simply press cancel to open in the Editor. You can also preview your .md file by clicking the ‘preview’ icon as explained here: Markdown Preview in vscode. Standard software project READMEs can often run into the thousands or tens of thousands of words in length; yours need not be that long, but should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail!

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! A README.md in the neighborhood of 500 words is likely to be sufficient for describing your project and all aspects of its functionality. If unable to reach that threshold, that probably means your project is insufficiently complex.

Getting Started
Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

What will your software do? = My software will be a game that be a turn based game that will fight thru areas and fight various enemies maybe get power ups or better equipment to deal with enemies 
TODO What features will it have?
How will it be executed? = Will use Pygame library 
TODO What new skills will you need to acquire?
What topics will you need to research? Pygame library
If working with one or two classmates, who will do what? Working by myself.
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.
